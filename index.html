                        <p>After spending a few years in Wyomingâ€™s beautiful Teton range, I moved to Oregon to continue
                            my passion for living outdoors and building things. Whether creating complex, craft cocktails
                            as a seasoned bartender, outdoor furniture for my backyard, or fun and creative web apps, I
                            enjoy tinkering and building. As a kid I loved taking things apart, seeing how they worked, then
                            putting them back together. Some things never change.</p>
                        <p> I build mobile-first, responsive, web apps using industry best practices, and have a strong understanding
                            of version-control, comprehensive testing and continuous integration.
                            While I am most comfortable with the React/Redux, Node.js, MongoDb and
                            Mocha/Chai stack, I am in the process of learning Python and am always ready to take on new challenges!

                        faster than ever before.</p>
                    <p>
                        After creating an account, a user can login, and start learning Spanish. The user will be presented with a Spanish word,
                        and they will have to enter the correct English translation. The app will keep track of how many
                        correct answers there are, sorting the words the user gets wrong towards the front of the deck and
                        the ones the user gets correct towards the back. This method ensures that the user spends more time
                        practicing the words they do not know well. A user can also access a page that displays their statistcs.</p>
