## Portfolio
Here you can learn a about me and what I have been working on!

Whether creating complex, craft cocktails as a seasoned bartender, outdoor furniture for my backyard, or fun and creative web apps, I enjoy tinkering and building. As a kid I loved taking things apart, seeing how they worked, then putting them back together. Some things never change.
